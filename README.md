I wanted somewhere online to make quick, organised notes to refer too later or when I needed too remember some info but didn't have time that I could access anywhere with an internet connection, that is customized and customzeable. This helps reduce time with all the varying sources of note taking that requires a phone, local machine, or paper! (what's that?).

This application is run completely in the browser. you may visit [https://scribbles-the--note-taker.herokuapp.com/]. However, see below to load application on your local machine using node.

## Further Developments

### Additional Features

- 1. Later I will be adding a calendar, which will provide standard business hours. This information will be saved and rendered when previous dates are selected

- 2. In addition, color coding, changing existing notes, mark as complete, base importance, and additional UI changes.
